September - December 2021

## Course 

A series of theoretical topics matched with corresponding data and estimation.  The readings are incomplete, but the intention is to present a bunch of open problems which are - in Li Hao's words - actionable.  That means they can be immediately used for honors thesis, 2nd year papers, thesis topics, etc.  Open problems will be both theoretical and empirical.
## Course Materials and Requirements.

There is no textbook for the course, all readings,notebooks and many datasets will be available.  The list at [https://github.com/michaelpetersubc/Econ49n/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/michaelpetersubc/Econ49n/blob/main/README.md).

Computational tools to be used include jupyter notebooks, python and julia.

Meetings are Friday at 2PM.  There will be presentations by multiple speakers.

Grades are based on individual projects which you will present.  The first part of the course at least will be on zoom to keep it as open as possible.

Too make it easy to communicate please join the dicord channel Econ514.  Use the text channel econ49n to communicate about the course.  We'll also have occaisional video meetings.   If you don't use discord get an account from discord.com.  If you need an invite you can ask anyone you know in the group.
